## What this repo is
Jersey City is a dense, urban area and it should have the pedestrian experience to match. This supremely barebones site, borne by a [tweet](https://twitter.com/ZaidaGrunes/status/1546899518867886081?s=20&t=57oT6muvi6C2CaPLyT7qpg) and a [reply](https://twitter.com/robhisme/status/1547598921416916993?s=20&t=57oT6muvi6C2CaPLyT7qpg), seeks to track where JC's sidewalks fall short.

## What this repo isn't
Technically interesting.

The "architecture" is 
* a hand crafted custom google map
* embedded into a single html file
* that's synced to S3 on merge
* and hosted as a static site from there

Respect the goal and the minimalism, but nothing more.
